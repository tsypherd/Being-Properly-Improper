# Being-Properly-Improper

Code for our publication, "Being Properly Improper" https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/sypherd22a.html, which appeared in the 2022 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). 

The code is a series of boosting experiments, assessing the robustness of several state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., AdaBoost and XGBoost) versus our proposed algorithm, PILBoost, under various kinds of training-time noise (i.e., label, feature, and adversarial), all on tabular datasets.
