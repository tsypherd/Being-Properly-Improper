# Being-Properly-Improper

Code for my publication, "Being Properly Improper" https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/sypherd22a.html, which appeared in the 2022 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). 

The code is a series of boosting experiments, assessing the robustness of various algorithms (e.g., AdaBoost and XGBoost) versus our proposed algorithm, PILBoost, under various kinds of noise (i.e., label, feature, and adversarial), all on tabular datasets.
